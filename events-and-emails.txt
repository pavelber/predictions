1. Prediction created => email to creator, witness, opponent
2. Witness or creator approved approval => email to creator, witness, opponent
3. Witness confirmed that prediction realized/not realized => email to creator, witness, opponent AND OBSERVER
4. One week before date and still not solved => email to creator, witness, opponent
5. Date approached and still not solved => email to creator, witness, opponent
6. One week after the date and still not solved => email to creator, witness, opponent


Simplifications:
1. No text, title, date, witness, opponent change after creation
2. No removal of approval or event confirmation
