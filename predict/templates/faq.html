    <P>
    <H3>What the hell?</H3>
    Arg You! is designed to help you make wagers with your friends. All you need to do is invite two friends- one of whom
    will serve as your opponent (AKA, the person who disagrees with you on the future outcome of an event), and a
    referee- (AKA, your second friend, who will serve as a judge and will settle the bet, after whatever you bet on is
    already determined).
    </P>

    <P>
    <H3>Can I bet on money?</H3>
    Arg You! does not handle money transfers, so wagering money using Arg You! would not be possible. However, nothing really
    stops you from giving/taking money after losing/winning a bet.
    </P>

    <P>
    <H3>Which kind of events can I bet on the outcome of? </H3>
    Anything! Whether it's on the winner of the next elections or which team will make it to the play-offs, we're not
    here to judge.

    </P>

    <P>
    <H3>Can I change the description/topic of my bet after creating it?</H3>
    Only before any of your friends have confirmed their participation in the wager.
    </P>

    <P>
    <H3>Can other people see my bets and predictions?</H3>
    Others can see what the bet is about but they won't know who the people behind it or the participants are. If you
    don't want others to know your wager exists, you can use the private mode, which is still in development and will
    soon be available.
    </P>

    <P>
    <H3>A bet I saw really got me interested and I want to see how it plays out. Can I do that?</H3>
    Yes, you can subscribe to another person's bet and get notified about the results. However, you will not be able to
    see the names of the participants since those are kept in secret.
    </P>
